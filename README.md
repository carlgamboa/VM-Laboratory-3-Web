## Challenges Faced:
During deployment, I encountered issues running certain commands like sudo apt install python3-pip and pip3 install flask django on my Lubuntu VM. The commands didn't work without using &&, which caused some confusion. Additionally, there was an error with the __name__ variable in my app.py, which was missing double underscores (__) causing an issue during execution. After fixing these issues, everything ran smoothly.

## What I Learned:
I learned that configuring Linux servers for hosting web apps can sometimes be tricky, especially when certain commands don't work as expected due to missing dependencies or incorrect syntax. Setting up firewalls and ensuring the correct IP address is used for accessing the web app remotely is also key.

##  Framework Experience:
Flask was the easiest for me to use, especially since I’m already familiar with Django. Flask’s minimalistic approach allowed me to focus more on the design and functionality of the app without getting overwhelmed by complex setups.

## Real-World Simulation:
Deploying this app in a VM was a great way to simulate real-world cloud hosting. It gave me insight into how a web app can be hosted on a remote server, accessed via an IP address, and managed through commands in the terminal.
