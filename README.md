## Frameworks used

- Flask

## Any issues encountered and solutions

- **Networking** â€“ Could not connect the host to the web. Switched network adapter from NAT to Bridged Adapter.  
- **Commands** â€“ Certain commands cannot be defined like flask (Command 'flask' cannot be found). Worked around the issue by updating and installing flask (sudo apt install python3-flask) 
- **Coding** - Trying to add a simple CSS with less experience. I studied for a while to get it run as how i envisioned it in my mind.

## How to Run the Web App

> Run theses codes in the terminal (Ubuntu)

1. cd ~/my_flask_app
2. python3 app.py

> From here there should be an address running on http://192.168.18.9:5000. Run this address on the host's browser.


## Challenges Faced:
While following the procedures, I had issues following in between steps. There are steps where you are to create templates under nano commands before I could actually do the coding. I also had networking issues, when I tried connecting via NAT I could not open the web from the host, then I tried switching to a Bridged Adapter and it worked.    

## What I Learned:
Linux is a bit complex because I have to do most things via commands, especially when certain commands don't work but when you get the hang of it gets easier. 

##  Framework Experience:
Flask was very straightforward and basic, aything else goes down to the coding experience. Styling with .css is easy when you have experience in JAVA and also .jsp to create the very HTML. Most of these I understood because of my experience with JAVA.

## Real-World Simulation:
Deploying this app in a VM was a great way to simulate real-world cloud hosting. It gave me insight into how a web app can be hosted on a remote server, accessed via an IP address, and managed through commands in the terminal.
